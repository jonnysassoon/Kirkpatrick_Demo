<h1>Kirkpatrick's Algorithm</h1>
<p>I created an application in Processing that provides an interactive demo and visualization of Kirkpatrick's point location algorithm. (You can find the original paper <a href = "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b2e6/6a427d18701f71818e9d72a27416e373c80e.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<h2> Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>If you do not have it installed already, install the Processing application. You can download it <a href = "https://processing.org/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Next, clone/download <a href = "https://github.com/jonnysassoon/Kirkpatrick_Demo" target = "_blank">my repository</a> on github. <b>Read the README</b></li>
	<li>Once the files are downloaded, simply open one of the files in Processing (this will open the entire folder), and run the program.</li>
</ol>
